# Working with wiki pages

Groups.io provides a Wiki feature that members can use to view, create, and edit wiki pages on a group’s website. Example uses for a group wiki include (but are not limited to):

Providing a repository of information that is relevant to the group—for example, project ideas for a woodworking club, recipes and cooking tips for a cooking club, a membership handbook for a social organization, and so on
Documenting frequently asked questions and their answers
> Note: Group owners determine whether the Wiki feature is available in their groups and, if it is, who can view, create, and edit wiki pages: the general public (view only), all group members, or only group owners and moderators.
