# GitHub Project - How we work togeter

## Consensus Based Projects

These projects are run via consensus with the same rules applied in all the working groups. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, [click here](https://openchain-project.github.io/github_training/), for our GitHub guidelines. If you need any one on one trainging, please let the team know.

## GitHub Consensus Based Projects
For example, projects related to creating whitepapers or specifications.

## Owners
Only Chairs/Project leads have the right to accept or reject any changes.

## How do you reach an agreement?

## Discussion Phase

 - People submit pull requests.<br>
 - There may be a discussion on the pull request.<br>
 - The pull request can be updated as a result of the discussion.<br>

## Review and Approval Phase

 - At the decision of the chairs, the PR enters a Review & Approval (R&A) process for a period of time determined by the chair.<br>
 - The PR will be tagged with a label to indicate how much time there is for the R&A process.<br>
  - 0 Days - Minor, Editorial Changes.<br>
  - 1 or 2 Days for Minor Changes<br>
  - 3 or 5 Days for Major Changes.<br>
 - If there are no sustained objections after that time period, the PR is merged.<br>
 - If there are objections, the person who made the objection needs to be made happy through reworking the pull request.<br>
 - If the person making the objection cannot be made happy there is a vote.<br>
