## Scope

The Green Software Foundationâ€™s Manifesto, is the public facing declaration of the policy and aims of the Foundation. It describes the set of core values of the Foundation and how we operationalise those values. It is used to both inform and guide the decisions and behaviours of the people inside the Foundation and signal to external stakeholders what's important to the Foundation.

## Mission & Vision
Mission: Build a trusted ecosystem of people, standards, tooling and best practices for creating and building green software.  
 
**Vision**: Change the culture of building software across the tech industry, so sustainability becomes a core priority to software teams, just as important as performance, security, cost and accessibility.
