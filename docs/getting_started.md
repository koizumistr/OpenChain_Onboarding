# Getting Started

Welcome to the [OpenChain](https://www.openchainproject.org/). We are excited to have you join our community.  Our global community encompasses hundreds of companies and thousands of people dedicated to making open source license compliance more effective and efficient. This is more than an ISO standard. We work together to share knowledge, to produce reference material, and to offer direct community support globally and locally. Take a moment to learn about some of the people behind this collaborative effort.
