# Getting Started

Welcome to the [Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation). We are excited to have you join our community. We have a guidebook with helpful information about how we work, valuable links, FAQ and contact info. So if you are going to bookmark one thing, make it that guidebook.


## Important First Steps

1- Firstly, please join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/greensoftwarefdn/signup) and introduce yourself in the [#introductions](https://greensoftwarefdn.slack.com/archives/C028640QYSV) channel. We would love to hear a little bit about yourself and your motivations. If you don't have access to Slack yet, please contact helpdesk@greensoftware.io.

2 - The Foundation functions as a set of smaller working groups, each with its own set of projects and scope. Your next task is to decide which of these working groups you would like to be involved in. 

Please join working groups by filling out **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbmtso8IprXx_PlHwhTFCoTZkmtc7HuDPdXTP9EOXvupVYrw/viewform)**.

The time commitment will be a few hours a month, at least, for each Working Group. In addition, you will receive another welcome email for each of the Working Groups you joined with specific instructions about how to get involved with them.

## Standards Working Group
Develop a series of baseline specifications for Green Software. 
Ensure that the specifications can be implemented in an interoperable fashion on the computing platforms in widespread use in both developed and developing regions.

## Innovation Working Group
Direct open-source, open-data and academic research in areas that advance the field of green software.
Sponsor key open-source and open-data projects to give confidence they will be supported and maintained for the long term.

## Trademark Working Group
Ensure the Foundationâ€™s trademarks are being used correctly and used in a context that doesn't diminish the Foundation's value.
Define guidance regarding when, how and in what context the Foundations trademarks can be used.

## Community Working Group
Facilitate broad adoption of green software standards and best practices through the creation of partnerships, content, events and programs.
Ensure diverse participation of stakeholders in the development and implementation of green software.
