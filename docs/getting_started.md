# Getting Started

Welcome to the [Foundation](https://www.openchainproject.org/). We are excited to have you join our community. We have a guidebook with helpful information about how we work, valuable links, FAQ and contact info. So if you are going to bookmark one thing, make it that guidebook.

## Important First Steps

Please take a moment to join our OpenChain community.

## 1. Slack

Join the OpenChain [<img src="./img/slack.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>](https://openchainproject.slack.com/) community and introduce yourself in the [#introductions](https://openchainproject.slack.com/archives/C03G1FE8T0W) channel. We would love to hear a little bit about yourself and your motivations. If you don't have access to Slack yet, please contact mailto:helpdesk@lists.openchainproject.org.

## 2. GitHub

Have a look at our OpenChain [<img src="./img/github_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project) projects. OpenChain functions as a set of smaller working groups, each with its own set of projects and scope. Your next task is to decide which of these working groups you would like to be involved in.
