## [Working with files](https://groups.io/helpcenter/membersmanual/1/working-with-files)
Groups.io provides a Files feature that members can use to view and upload files on a groupâ€™s website. Files can be organized in folders.

> Note: Group owners determine whether the Files feature is available in their groups and, if it is, who can view and upload files: all members or only owners and moderators.
- The size limit for an uploaded file is:
  - 100MB in legacy Basic groups
  - 500MB in Premium and Enterprise groups
